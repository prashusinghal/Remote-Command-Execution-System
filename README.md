Remote Command Execution System (Python)

This project implements a Remote Command Execution System using Python socket programming.
It enables a server to handle multiple clients simultaneously, receive commands from them, execute those commands on the server machine, and return real-time output back to each client.

The system demonstrates strong concepts of network programming, concurrency, inter-process communication, and command execution pipelines.

🚀 Features

Supports multiple clients at the same time
Real-time remote command execution
Threaded server architecture for concurrency
Command output returned reliably to each client
TCP-based communication for stability
Lightweight, extensible, and easy to deploy

🧠 Technical Concepts

Python Socket Programming (TCP)
Multi-threading
Concurrency Handling
Process Execution (subprocess module)
Networking & Communication Protocols
Error Handling and Stream Management

▶️ How to Run

Start the Server
python server.py

Start the Client
python client.py

Open multiple terminals to test parallel multi-client execution.
